# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `k8s/base/namespace.yaml` (deleted), `k8s/base/kustomization.yaml`: remove duplicate `Namespace/shopping-cart-apps` definition — namespace is now owned by the dedicated `shopping-cart-namespace` ArgoCD Application in k3d-manager; resolves `SharedResourceWarning` that kept this app `OutOfSync`
- Align k8s manifests with data-layer: correct DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASSWORD, RABBITMQ_USER, RABBITMQ_PASSWORD, fix DATABASE_HOST to postgresql-products.shopping-cart-data.svc.cluster.local, fix readiness probe path /health/ready→/health

### Changed
- Reduce deployment replicas from 2 to 1 for dev/test environment; delete HPA (`minReplicas: 2` was scaling pods back up on single-node cluster); will reintroduce in v1.1.0 EKS
